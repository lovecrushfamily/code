## Permutation and Binary Generator

This repository contains C++ code to generate permutations of a numerical array and generate binary strings of a given length.

### Permutation Generator

The `generatePermutation` function is a recursive function that generates all possible permutations of a numerical array. The function takes three parameters:

* `nums`: The numerical array to be permuted.
* `start`: The starting index of the array to be permuted.
* `permutations`: A vector of vectors of integers to store the permutations.

The function first checks if the starting index is equal to the last index of the array. If it is, then the function adds the current permutation to the `permutations` vector and returns. Otherwise, the function loops through the remaining elements of the array and swaps the current element with the element at the starting index. The function then recursively calls itself with the updated starting index and the updated permutation. After the recursive call, the function swaps the current element back with the element at the starting index.

The `getPermutations` function is a wrapper function that calls the `generatePermutation` function with the starting index set to 0 and an empty `permutations` vector. The function then returns the `permutations` vector.

### Binary Generator

The `generateBinary` function is a recursive function that generates all possible binary strings of a given length. The function takes two parameters:

* `n`: The length of the binary string to be generated.
* `current`: The current binary string being generated.

The function first checks if the length of the binary string is 0. If it is, then the function prints the current binary string to the console and returns. Otherwise, the function recursively calls itself with the length of the binary string decremented by 1 and the current binary string appended with a 0. The function then recursively calls itself with the length of the binary string decremented by 1 and the current binary string appended with a 1.

### Usage

To use the permutation generator, create a `vector` of integers and pass it to the `getPermutations` function. The function will return a `vector` of `vectors` of integers, where each inner `vector` is a permutation of the original `vector`.

To use the binary generator, call the `generateBinary` function with the desired length of the binary string. The function will print all possible binary strings of that length to the console.
